* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project was to condense a list a of grocery items and add the frequency in which those items were listed in a new file. The user could use a menu to search for an item and their frequencies or to have a list printed of all items with frequencies     included.

* What did you do particularly well?

  Creating a menu loop that correctly pulls information from the functions/class and responds to user input is one thing I did particulary well.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I could have enhanced my code by creating the class in separate files so that the main source code wasn't as cluttered.

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The most challenging code to write was using maps to consolidate the lines in my list as two variables and then using the pair function to separate them. I referred to the Zybook reference to help complete these. 
  
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Read and writing to files, creating object-oriented classes, and loops are skills that I believe will be transferrable for future projects.

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  My code is maintainable and readable by using correct spacing between functions and lines of code that served specific purposes.
